# üáÆüá≥ IndiaAI - ML Hackathon 2025: Mineral Prospectivity Mapping  
**Team: ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§∑‡§£AI**

This repository contains the complete solution submitted for the **IndiaAI - ML Hackathon 2025**, focused on generating high-confidence mineral prospectivity maps using supervised machine learning models and ensemble techniques.
## üß† Problem Formulation

REE prospectivity mapping was framed as a **binary classification** task.  
Model outputs are interpreted as **probability values** indicating the likelihood of mineralization.

- Ensemble learning was used to reduce individual model bias and improve predictive confidence.
- Multiple negative sample strategies (soil-informed vs random) were evaluated for robustness.
- Uncertainty quantification was incorporated through ensemble variance.
